# 0x03. AirBnB clone - Deploy static
# Concepts
_For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:_
* [CI/CD](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/43)
* [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

## 1. CI/CD
The lean/agile methodology (See: [Twelve Principles of Agile Software](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)) is now widely used by the industry and one of its key principles is to iterate as fast as possible. If you apply this to software engineering, it means that you should:
* code
* ship your code
* measure the impact
* learn from it
* fix or improve it
* start over

As fast as possible and with small iterations in days or even hours (whereas it used to be weeks or even months). One big advantage is that if product development is going the wrong direction, fast iteration will allow to quickly detect this, and avoid wasting time.

From a technical point of view, quicker iterations mean fewer lines of code being pushed at every deploy, which allows easy performance impact measurement and easy troubleshooting if something goes wrong (better to debug a small code change than weeks of new code).

Applied to software engineering, [CI/CD](https://digital.ai/catalyst-blog/walk-before-you-run-understanding-ci-in-cd/) (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a principle that allows individuals or teams to have a lean/agile way of working.

This translates to a “shipping pipeline” which is often built with multiple tools such as:
* Shipping the code:
    * Capistrano, Fabric
* Encapsulating the code
    * Docker, Packer
* Testing the code
    * Jenkins, CircleCi, Travis
* Measuring the code
    * Datadog, Newrelic, Wavefront

## 2. AirBnB clone

![65f4a1dd9c51265f49d0](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/acf08a8b-f4e4-47b6-b32e-25d73c434b32)

I know you were waiting for it: it’s here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Final product

![da2584da58f1d99a72f0a4d8d22c1e485468f941](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/1841b787-c8af-49b4-9c5e-dab0a5633846)

## Concepts to learn
* [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) - and please work all together on tests cases
* **Python packages** concept page
* Serialization/Deserialization
* `*args, **kwargs`
* `datetime`
* More coming soon!

## Steps
You won’t build this application all at once, but step by step.

Each step will link to a concept:

## The console
* create your data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## Web static
* learn HTML/CSS
* create the HTML of your application
* create template of each object

![87c01524ada6080f40fc](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/704ad78d-053c-4c30-bedc-3d87b19ebc69)

## MySQL storage
* replace the file storage by a Database storage
* map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

![5284383714459fa68841](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/f492838c-4d2a-4a75-8324-cc903634c361)

## Web framework - templating
* create your first web server in Python
* make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

![cb778ec8a13acecb53ef](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/e801f00d-ced0-42ce-9bfc-acd1c2273f3e)

## RESTful API
* expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
* manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

![06fccc41df40ab8f9d49](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/d0515e05-f4b0-44a7-bbbc-f7ad7ecc159f)

## Web dynamic
* learn JQuery
* load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

![d2d06462824fab5846f3](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/50a350bb-2492-4701-a198-ef284721d971)

## Files and Directories
* `models` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
* `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
* `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
* `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    * attributes: `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`
    * methods: `save()` and `to_json()`
* `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: `file_storage.py`.

## Storage
Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:
* Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
* Provide default value of any attribute
* In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage

## How can I store my instances?
That’s a good question. So let’s take a look at this code:
```groovy
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = []
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
```
Here, I’m creating a student and store it in a list. But after this program execution, my Student instance doesn’t exist anymore.
```groovy
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
save(students) # save all Student objects to a file
```
Nice!

But how it works?

First, let’s look at `save(students)`:
* Can I write each `Student` object to a file => _NO_, it will be the memory representation of the object. For another program execution, this memory representation can’t be reloaded.
* Can I write each `Student.name` to a file => _YES_, but imagine you have other attributes to describe `Student`? It would start to be become too complex.

The best solution is to convert this list of `Student` objects to a JSON representation.

Why JSON? Because it’s a standard representation of object. It allows us to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly to be understood by another language/program.

Example:
* My Python program creates `Student` objects and saves them to a JSON file
* Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate its own `Student` class/representation

And the `reload()`? now you know the file is a JSON file representing all `Student` objects. So `reload()` has to read the file, parse the JSON string, and re-create `Student` objects based on this data-structure.

## File storage == JSON serialization
For this first step, you have to write in a file all your objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and restore them when you start it. You can’t store and restore a Python instance of a class as “Bytes”, the only way is to convert it to a serializable data structure:
* convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method `my_instance.to_json()` to retrieve a dictionary
* convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be YAML, XML, CSV…) - for us it will be a `my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)`
* write this string to a file on disk

And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:
* read a string from a file on disk
* convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON representation, so it’s easy to convert - for us it will be a `my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)`
* convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a `my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)`

### `*args, **kwargs`

#### [`How To Use them`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python-3)
How do you pass arguments to a function?
```groovy
def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
But with this function definition, you must call `my_fct` with 2 parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
What? What’s `*args` and `**kwargs`?
* `*args` is a Tuple that contains all arguments
* `*kwargs` is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value

A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, `*args` is the list of anonymous arguments, no name, just an order. `**kwargs` is the dictionary with all named arguments.

Examples:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

my_fct() # () - {}
my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
```
Perfect? Of course you can mix both, but the order should be first all anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}
```
You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how your variables are stored.

### `datetime`
`datetime` is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc…

In this example, you create an instance of `datetime` with the current date and time:
```groovy
from datetime import datetime

date_now = datetime.now()
print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922
```
`date_now` is an object, so you can manipulate it:
```groovy
from datetime import timedelta

date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
print(date_tomorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922
```
… you can also store it:
```groovy
a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}
```
What? What’s this format when a `datetime` instance is in a datastructure??? It’s unreadable.

How to make it readable: [`strftime`](https://strftime.org/)
```groovy
print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
```

# Background Context
Ever since you completed project [0x0F. Load balancer](https://github.com/elyse502/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x0F-load_balancer) of the SysAdmin track, you’ve had 2 web servers + 1 load balancer but nothing to distribute with them.

It’s time to make your work public!

In this first deployment project, you will be deploying your `web_static` work. You will use `Fabric` (for Python3). Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via `sudo`) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution. This concept is important: execute commands locally or remotely. Locally means in your laptop (physical laptop or inside your Vagrant), and Remotely means on your server(s). Fabric is taking care of all network connections (SSH, SCP etc.), it’s an easy tool for transferring, executing, etc. commands from locale to a remote server.

Before starting, please fork the repository `AirBnB_clone_v2` from your partner if you don’t have it

# Tasks 📃
## 0. Prepare your web servers: [0-setup_web_static.sh](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/0-setup_web_static.sh)
A Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of `web_static`. It must:
* Install Nginx if it not already installed
* Create the folder `/data/` if it doesn’t already exist
* Create the folder `/data/web_static/` if it doesn’t already exist
* Create the folder `/data/web_static/releases/` if it doesn’t already exist
* Create the folder `/data/web_static/shared/` if it doesn’t already exist
* Create the folder `/data/web_static/releases/test/` if it doesn’t already exist
* Create a fake HTML file `/data/web_static/releases/test/index.html` (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
* Create a symbolic link `/data/web_static/current` linked to the `/data/web_static/releases/test/` folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
* Give ownership of the `/data/` folder to the `ubuntu` user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
* Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of `/data/web_static/current/` to `hbnb_static` (ex: `https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static`). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
   * Use `alias` inside your Nginx configuration
   * [Tip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631933/nginx-static-file-serving-confusion-with-root-alias)

Your program should always exit successfully. **_Don’t forget to run your script on both of your web servers_**.

In optional, you will redo this task but by using Puppet
```groovy

## 1. Compress before sending: [1-pack_web_static.py](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/1-pack_web_static.py)
A Fabric script that generates a [.tgz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29) archive from the contents of the `web_static` folder of your AirBnB Clone repo, using the function `do_pack`.
* Prototype: `def do_pack():`
* All files in the folder `web_static` must be added to the final archive
* All archives must be stored in the folder `versions` (your function should create this folder if it doesn’t exist)
* The name of the archive created must be `web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz`
* The function `do_pack` must return the archive path if the archive has been correctly generated. Otherwise, it should return `None`

## 2. Deploy archive!: [2-do_deploy_web_static.py](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/2-do_deploy_web_static.py)
A Fabric script (based on the file `1-pack_web_static.py`) that distributes an archive to your web servers, using the function `do_deploy`:
* Prototype: def `do_deploy(archive_path):`
* Returns `False` if the file at the path `archive_path` doesn’t exist
* The script should take the following steps:
   * Upload the archive to the `/tmp/` directory of the web server
   * Uncompress the archive to the folder `/data/web_static/releases/<archive filename without extension>` on the web server
   * Delete the archive from the web server
   * Delete the symbolic link `/data/web_static/current` from the web server
   * Create a new the symbolic link `/data/web_static/current` on the web server, linked to the new version of your code (`/data/web_static/releases/<archive filename without extension>`)
* All remote commands must be executed on your both web servers (using `env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02']` variable in your script)
* Returns `True` if all operations have been done correctly, otherwise returns `False`
* You must use this script to deploy it on your servers: `xx-web-01` and `xx-web-02`

In the following example, the SSH key and the username used for accessing to the server are passed in the command line. Of course, you could define them as Fabric environment variables (ex: `env.user =...`)

**Disclaimer**: commands execute by Fabric displayed below are linked to the way we implemented the archive function `do_pack` - like the `mv` command - depending of your implementation of it, you may don’t need it

## 3. Full deployment: [3-deploy_web_static.py](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/3-deploy_web_static.py)
A Fabric script (based on the file `2-do_deploy_web_static.py`) that creates and distributes an archive to your web servers, using the function `deploy`:
* Prototype: `def deploy()`:
* The script should take the following steps:
   * Call the `do_pack()` function and store the path of the created archive
   * Return `False` if no archive has been created
   * Call the `do_deploy(archive_path)` function, using the new path of the new archive
   * Return the return value of `do_deploy`
* All remote commands must be executed on both of web your servers (using `env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02']` variable in your script)
* You must use this script to deploy it on your servers: `xx-web-01` and `xx-web-02`

In the following example, the SSH key and the username used for accessing to the server are passed in the command line. Of course, you could define them as Fabric environment variables (ex: env.user =…)

## 4. Keep it clean!: [100-clean_web_static.py](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2/blob/master/100-clean_web_static.py)
A Fabric script (based on the file `3-deploy_web_static.py`) that deletes out-of-date archives, using the function `do_clean`:
* Prototype: `def do_clean(number=0):`
* `number` is the number of the archives, including the most recent, to keep.
   * If `number` is 0 or 1, keep only the most recent version of your archive.
   * if `number` is 2, keep the most recent, and second most recent versions of your archive.
   * etc.
* Your script should:
   * Delete all unnecessary archives (all archives minus the number to keep) in the `versions` folder
   * Delete all unnecessary archives (all archives minus the number to keep) in the `/data/web_static/releases` folder of both of your web servers
* All remote commands must be executed on both of your web servers (using the `env.hosts = ['<IP web-01>', 'IP web-02']` variable in your script)

In the following example, the SSH key and the username used for accessing to the server are passed in the command line. Of course, you could define them as Fabric environment variables (ex: env.user =…)
